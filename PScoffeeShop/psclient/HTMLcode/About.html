	<p><i>Quote: "Eat the rich"~Bernie Sanders</i></p><br>
	<p>Like all owners, you must start somewhere. Shannon first worked as a full-time Barista. Shannon developed a love for coffee craftsmanship and the coffee-making industry. As a barista, she noticed things she liked and didn’t like as their business was run, and well P.S. was brewed into existence! Anyone can make coffee, but not all coffee shops are unique and connect on a human level. P.S. brews acceptance, understanding, affordability, and quality. Shannon believes in creating a different perspective for coffee industries, truly valuing human connections.</p><br>

	<h2><i><u>Coffee for rejects, outcasts, and everyone else. </u></i></h2><br>
	<p>“I just want to create a safe and affordable environment for everyone. Everyone comes from different backgrounds, cultures, and are unique in various ways. You never know what someone may be going through and to provide a place where we can give them that type of safe space is sacred, it’s special.”</p></br>

	<h2><i><u>Coming to Brew</u></i></h2><br>
	<p>Because P.S. is centered around human connection, it is important to support other causes. Shannon has decided to donate 10% of each order for her annual donation event: “Fill Your Cup to Fill Another”. She also plans to be involved in any community events and is open to customer suggestions. Shannon’s aspirations are to create connections within the community and eventually share this environment with others in different states. In the meantime, Shannon focuses on creating support, acceptance, and understanding at P.S. by selecting things and people to make this environment come true. Lots to look forward to...Brewing it all is coming soon! </p><br>
